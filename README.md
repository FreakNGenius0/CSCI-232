# CSCI-232
This is an example git repo for CSCI 232. It includes [example code](code/Fibonacci/) and the [lab write-up](docs/), as well as this readme.

The example program finds the n<sup>th</sup> number in the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). **Note:** this program is very basic and will break if anything other than an int or "e" is entered.

The [docs](docs/) folder has a simple LaTeX doc for the PDF required by the lab.
